It was supposed to go through Heroku but I had issues with my login and I could not log in to upload it. I should be able to log into heroku in 2 business days, just waiting on a recovery code they are going to send me.

You write the title and text in the note app and express sends the data to db.json. the save button saves the note, the plus  button starts a new note and the trashcan deletes the notes.
